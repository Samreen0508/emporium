Object Oriented Database
It is a system where information or data is represented in the form of objects which is used in object-oriented programming.

Hierarchical Database
It is a system where the data elements have a one to many relationship (1: N). Here data is organized like a tree which is similar to a folder structure in your computer system.

Network database
